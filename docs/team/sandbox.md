# [Virtual World Sandbox][sandbox]

The ADL [Virtual World Sandbox][github] is an application based on the [Virtual World Framework][vwf] with multiplayer simulation and collaborative content authoring capabilities. The entirety of the application runs in native Javascript, so no plugins or installs are required. As such, the Sandbox is a no-install, game authoring environment and a game runtime environment, all in the browser. It is primarily build using NodeJS, Express, AngularJS, jQuery, and is database agnostic.

My role in this project has been very fluid. I was originally tasked redesigning the front facing website to support the Knockout.js MVVM framework and Mustache server side bindings. Then, I was later tasked with making a number of fixes and enhancements to the data access layer and other server side components. After that, I eventually began creating [Selenium tests][selenium] (via [webdriver.io][webdriver]) to ensure integrity of the system, especially with features that virtually all users rely on.

I'm currently working on a *very significant* refactor in the Sandbox's *massive* client side architecture to enable two-way data binding with AngularJS.
