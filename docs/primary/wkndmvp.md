WkndMVP (Weekend Minimum Viable Product) is a community, it's a series of e-hackathons, it's a way of life (okay, maybe I'm pushing it). [/r/WeekendMVP][reddit] is a brand new community for all kinds of builders (not just developers; we have designers, marketers, business people, mentors, etc.) with the desire to ship MVPs and eventually take them to the next level.

The original idea for this was inspired by [/u/tianan][tianan]. In his post on Reddit, he offered to build MVPs for people over the weekend while his wife was away. We thought he was doing incredibly cool work and that there must be other people who would be eager to do the same! Over time, we found over 100 like-minded people from r/startups alone and eventually built our subscriber list to over 1,200 users!

The site is built entirely in Javascript via [NodeJS][node] and [Express][express] and features REST endpoints for doing things such as creating teams, creating team invitation links, removing yourself from a team, etc.

I am known as [/u/impressflow][impressflow] on Reddit.

Note: the live site is currently sitting behind HTTP Basic Auth. Use the credentials 'planners:We are the best planners ever!' to log in.
