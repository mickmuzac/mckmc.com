# [Disco Pet Revolution][disco]

Disco Pet Revolution (DPR) is a rhythm-based dancing game for those who are fans of games like Guitar Hero, Osu!, and DDR. It available for both iOS and Android devices via their respective stores and a private desktop version also exists. It is truly a cross platform game written entirely in Java using the [libGDX][libgdx] game framework and [RoboVM][robovm] with a couple of Objective-C to Java bindings mixed in. It is fully featured in that it supports social sharing, in-app purchases, various wardrobe unlocks, and enables full customization of all characters.

This project features a tool I custom built to facilitate the [creation of levels][creator] and also features server-side infrastructure enabling screenshot uploads. Note that the core of this project (the game) is not open source, though it can be made temporarily available if necessary.
