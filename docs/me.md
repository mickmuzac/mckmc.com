<p style="margin: 0;"><span class="h1">Welcome to the place I call... home.</span></p>

Hello, there! My name is Mick Muzac and I am a software engineer originally from the beautiful (and *very* warm) Orlando, Florida but I currently live in Brooklyn, NY and I couldn't think of a place I'd rather be at the moment.

I currently work at [Collage.com](https://www.collage.com/) where we work bring smiles to families everywhere.

For almost 4 years prior to Collage.com, I worked at [Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL)][adl] on education and training technologies, especially as they relate to the Department of Defense and the Federal Government at large. Here, I do full stack development mainly in Javascript (NodeJS, Express, AngularJS, random databases). I've also worked on projects that are written on a more traditional stack like C# and Java (see 3D Repository).

Even before that, I worked at the [University of Central Florida (UCF)][ucf] as a Web Developer during my time as a student majoring in Computer Engineering. Back in those days, I worked primarily with PHP, SQL Server, and MySQL. I was responsible for creating and maintaining web applications handling [student applications][ure] for [a number][gems] of [NSF funded programs][yes].

I'm also a *poker master* (not to be confused with [Pok√©mon Master][pokemon]). And I like (read: love) video games.

This page itself is [available on Github][github]. Meta, I know.
